## ⚠️ Action Required — Merge the Pull Request

**The chatbot, ID upload section, and payment fixes are NOT yet live** because the pull request is still a **Draft** (that's why there is no merge button).

### How to get the merge button — 2 steps:

1. Go to **https://github.com/kysboadi-afk/SLY-RIDES/pull/3**
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **"Ready for review"**
   - The merge button will now appear
3. Click **"Merge pull request"** → **"Confirm merge"**

Wait ~2 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild — then **www.slytrans.com** will have all features live.
